## Coded 100% with Claude Code

It's been more than 20 years since I was last able to code anything. However, I really wanted a visual aid for exploring music theory. There are probably more tools like this out there, but this one is done the way I wanted it to work.

This repository is an example of a simple tool created by a non-coder over a weekend, with just an idea and AI assistance. This is not a comprehensive harmony theory exploration tool. It's designed as an easy-to-use tool for beginners.

Feel free to explore the code, fork it, or use it for your own learning!

You can check out the music of my band Swetrik on streaming platforms or here: www.swetrik.cz

## Features
* **Interactive Chord Circle:** Visualize chords based on your chosen Tonic and Mode (Ionian, Dorian, Phrygian, Lydian, Mixolydian, Aeolian, Locrian). Diatonic motion is **mode-aware** — each mode has its own functional-move logic.
* **Harmonic Lenses:** Toggle different relationship types as colored arrows on the circle:
  * *Diatonic motion* — functional moves within the key
  * *Dominant resolution* — V7 → I (and V → i)
  * *Secondary dominants* — V7/ii, V7/iii, V7/IV…
  * *Tritone substitution* — dom7 ↔ dom7 a tritone away
  * *Modal interchange* — chords borrowed from the parallel mode
  * *Chromatic mediant* — same-quality chords ±M3/±m3
  * *Modal cadence* — the defining cadence of the current mode (e.g. ♭VII→I in Mixolydian, ♭II→i in Phrygian)
* **Chord Variations:** Extend any chord with maj7, m7, 6, add9, sus4, 9th, etc., and add the exact variation to your progression. Clicking a variation also updates the guitar diagram (see below).
* **Guitar Chord Diagrams:** Toggle the **🎸 Guitar** button to show how the focused chord is played on a guitar fretboard, with multiple voicings to cycle through. Shapes come from the open-source [`@tombatossals/chords-db`](https://github.com/tombatossals/chords-db) database.
* **Always-on Chord Panel:** Hover a chord for a quick preview, click to pin its full detail (notes, variations, guitar shape, outgoing relationships). With nothing selected it shows the key's tonic chord.
* **Bridge Function:**
  * *Between keys* — pivot chords, direct dominants, secondary dominants, chromatic mediants, and multi-step paths via intermediate keys
  * *Between chords* — ranked harmonic paths using the active lenses with voice-leading scoring
* **Preset Library:** Load classic progressions across Pop/Rock/J-pop, Cadences, Cycles, Reharmonizations, and Modulations — including *12-Bar Blues*, *Coltrane Changes*, *Royal Road (王道)*, *Axis Progression*, *Andalusian Cadence*, *Pachelbel / Kanon*, and more.
* **Progression Builder:** Click chords to build your progression, listen to it in the browser (Salamander Grand Piano samples), auto-decorate with extended chords (`+ COLOR`), and export as a MIDI file.
* **Voice-leading hint:** Toggle voice-leading data on outgoing relationships — common tones (♢) and total half-step movement (½) — to find the smoothest chord transitions.
